## Participation

With the global lockdown due to the Coronavirus spread, and as a team of innovators who believe in the important role technology plays in coming up with and implementing solutions for relevant problems.

I, alongside a group of very competent friends, have decided to participate in the [OMAC Hackathon](https://omachack.com/), and design an app to meet the need for people to have access to mental and emotional support through this tough and testing times.

Since mental and emotional well-being is this project’s focus, we have decided to give it the name “rou7” which translates to "soul" in Arabic.

Here are some screenshots and resources showing more details and what it looks like, achieved by our amazing designer Amine who I’d really like to recommend his creative work.
